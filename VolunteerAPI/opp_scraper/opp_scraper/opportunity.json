We are currently looking for a writer with some newsletter background to help us shape KeelWorks monthly newsletter. Looking for enthusiastic learner who can write professionally and with an interesting take on nonprofits. Our mission is to get people to work. We espectially focus on supporting economic parity. Our values are Honesty: Transparency, integrity, and a commitment to truth. Competence: Building for individual empowerment and mutual value. Diversity: Full inclusion with equality and dignity for all. Community: Mutual support: together, we can do anything! Leadership: Leading with integrity for the benefit of all. Our behavior will reflect our values. The Cause In this world there are the haves and the have nots. The haves come to the table, the have nots are on the outside looking in. It is easy to believe that we, with our sterling education, excellent job, good society, and more money than we really need, have these because we deserve them. And that those without these are without them because they simply didn\u2019t work for it. We believe life is more complicated than that. Given different circumstances, those on the inside and those on the outside might be reversed. We believe everyone has something essential to contribute. We believe inclusion makes for a more peaceful world. We believe we CAN foster sustainable and measured change. We think today\u2019s needy can be the helpers of tomorrow. Change is difficult, often because we are scared, ignorant, ill-equipped, and alone. KeelWorks addresses these factors for greater success. Our special \"sauce\" is: address the barriers, arm with basic competencies, provide the savvy of lessons learned, and provide a community of mutual support and accountability for as long as it takes. KeelWorks has no religious or political affiliation. We believe diversity, in all its forms, breeds perspective, and the learning is better for it. Rich and poor, intellectually advantaged and intellectually challenged, black, indigenous, asian, white, Muslim, Jew, Catholic, Hindu, or atheist; the broader the base, the better. We can help the unemployed create jobs where no jobs exist, we can help the displaced workers and homemakers reinvent themselves, we can help refugees from incarceration, tyranny, and poor choices redefine themselves for better futures. We can do this - only with your help. , please fill out this application: https://forms.gle/YA8xXiNJVEWmtLn39",

NOTE - You do not need to be a musician to assist - we mostly need friendly faces to help us interact with families at our exhibit. We bring guitars, ukuleles, keyboards and dozens of different types of percussion instruments for kids to play with - its basically a \"please touch museum\" for musical instruments. We're not teaching kids how to play, we are simply showing them how to make the sounds so they will be inspired to start their own musical journey. If you are interested please send a note and we'll reply right back - thanks in advance for your time and consideration! - Keep Music Alive is the founder of Teach Music Week (March) and Kids Music Day (October). Each year we partner with over 1,000 music school and store location in all 50 states, Canada and a dozen other countries to offer free lessons to new students (kids & adults) and hold special events that benefit kids playing music. Keep Music Alive is also the presenting organization for Make Music Day in the Philadelphia region on the Summer Solstice each year. Year round, Keep Music Alive presents dozens of Musical Instrument Petting Zoo events at schools, libraries and outdoor festivals as a way o introducing children to musical instruments.

    "description": "This is a UK volunteering opportunity, all volunteers must currently live in the UK. We need Volunteer Caseworkers in different locations across the country. As a Caseworker you will only ever be asked to visit clients within your local area, at a time to suit you. To find out if we need Caseworkers in your local area please visit our website and use the volunteer vacancy search tool. Caseworkers visit clients to work out what type of support they need. You will listen without judgement to assess and provide tailored support to help those serving, who have served and their families to navigate life in and beyond military service. Some examples of support are securing funding for special equipment for someone with a disability, adaptions to a property so an older client can remain at home or funds for a rental deposit. Caseworkers also sign-post clients onto specialist local services for advice on benefits, housing, mental health, debt, finding work etc. We\u2019ve been supporting the Armed Forces community since 1885. Our clients come from all backgrounds and age groups and may have served in WW2 or in a more recent conflict like the Falklands or Afghanistan. We\u2019d love the general public to understand what we do and how they can help us. There are SSAFA branches throughout the UK and overseas who support local volunteers to deliver services to veterans, serving personnel and their families. Some branches are divided into smaller divisions to ensure the best local service delivery. Each branch has a team of volunteer caseworkers, support volunteers, executive roles, and fundraisers. Volunteer Caseworkers are the lifeblood of SSAFA, supporting a growing number of people in need of financial, practical, and emotional support. Clients come from all backgrounds and age groups and may have served in WW2 or in a more recent conflict like Iraq or Afghanistan. The essential part of the role is visiting clients, so you will need access to a vehicle or another way to travel to meet clients at home or in a care home setting. As part of your local branch, you might have access to an office, but you can complete the administration part of the role from home as long as you have access to IT equipment and the internet. We welcome volunteers of all backgrounds, abilities, races, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, and of all faiths and none. SSAFA are committed to making reasonable adjustments to support volunteers with disabilities, so they have access to the same opportunities and experiences as volunteers who do not. 18 SSAFA undertakes a systematic approach and utmost care at every step of the process of volunteer recruitment, selection, and retention to ensure that those recruited are suitable and appropriate. Measures taken at points along this journey work together to make volunteering at SSAFA a positive and safe experience. Yes .  We will ask for two character references, this can be a former employer or someone that know you well (other than a relative  ) Yes, this is provided by SSAFA at no cost to the potential volunteer. This role requires an enhanced check (including checks against the children and adults barred list)",

I wish Hospice Volunteering onboarding was a snap, but it is a process... But really just for the human team member.  If you are ready to go through the process, because you know the benefit that you can bring to others, whose days are limited, please reply to this post and I'll send you details about our onboarding process.",

    "description": "Over the past year, I\u2019ve been working on a mission that matters deeply to me: helping African and Asian professionals take their place in the age of AI. Many have been left out of global conversations, not because they lack talent, but because they lack context, access, and strategic support. I\u2019ve run free bootcamps and coached aspiring tech professionals. Now, I\u2019m building a long-term system designed to unlock AI opportunities at scale, without relying on traditional gatekeepers or expensive platforms. While I won\u2019t share all the details yet, I\u2019m assembling a small team of focused content volunteers to help bring it to life. You\u2019ll help gather and format powerful content - real-world AI tools, short videos, trends, and case studies - based on specific prompts. Your work will empower others. This is a mutually beneficial opportunity that lasts 9 weeks. What You\u2019ll Do: You\u2019ll be assigned a set of short tasks (per week) that involve: Finding helpful short videos, charts, and online tools Summarizing specific trends and examples. Sourcing articles, walkthroughs, or practical how-tos Curating resources for different modules in our AI Bootcamp You will be reporting to a guide throughout the 9 week period. What You\u2019ll Gain: Credibility: You\u2019ll build real content inside a high-value AI product Proof of Work: This work is CV- and portfolio-worthy AI-Focused Content Portfolio: You\u2019ll work closely on cutting-edge content that speaks to today\u2019s tech economy. LinkedIn + Career Endorsement: Upon completion, I\u2019ll personally recommend you on your LinkedIn profile and any other job platform of your choice. Data & AI Mentorship (optional): I\u2019ll give you access to weekly mentorship that involves getting personalised 1-hr per week mentorships on Data while you expand your knowledge when sourcing the content. You Should NOT Apply If: You disappear without warning. You can\u2019t commit to delivering high quality content during the project duration (though we\u2019ll show you how) You need daily handholding to complete tasks. People who work well independently are invited. What\u2019s Required: A smartphone or laptop (recommended) with stable internet Ability to use Canva, ChatGPT, Google, YouTube and Docs. Ability to follow clear, structured tasks and meet deadlines Ability to communicate via Telegram and WhatsApp Willingness to learn and grow within a supportive culture. Would you love to join us? Kindly hit the volunteer button. There\u2019ll be a lot of communication during the first week. By then, everything will be clear. If you\u2019re interested, respond, and I\u2019ll reach out personally, send you a short form-then we can begin our communication from there. Please note: I want you to succeed in this volunteering opportunity. To do that, you'll need to respond to the email when sent, be apt to respond on Telegram and be a good communicator. You will receive a response in one to four days after applying. Keep checking your mail. God bless you!",

Founded in 1902, Bigs & Littles NYC Mentoring strives to transform the lives of children through one-to-one mentoring, while strengthening entire families in hardship. In keystone mentoring program, youth ages 7-19 (enrollment until age 17), are carefully matched with a Big Sister or Big Brother who serves as adviser, role model, and adult friend. Mentoring matches meet twice monthly for activities such as enjoying a show or ballgame, working together on a service project, or spending time talking and exploring NYC. Matches are supported by a dedicated Professional Program Manager to oversee and guide the match relationship, offering referrals and additional resources as needed. Our holistic approach to mentoring consists of working closely with the entire family, ensuring better outcomes. We know the program works: in 2024, 100% of our kids avoid pregnancy, 100% avoid arrest, 100% are promoted to the next grade, 100% graduate High School and 100% matriculate into college or a training program.

    "description": "We will be conducting our Crisis Intervention and Victimology training starting September 2, 2025 and would like to share this information with you and the community. Our Victim Advocate course is a well-structured, comprehensive, and hands-on training. The training teaches basic crisis intervention skills, concepts, and techniques. In addition, it examines various types of crimes and the specific victimization dynamics that victims of crimes may face, including common trauma reactions. You will also learn about the criminal justice system and what the role of an advocate entails throughout this process. This training is the gateway into volunteering and participating in an internship with the Victim Services Division.

    "description": "The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation - the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original substrate to another computational substrate of a neural prosthesis. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition. Our work spans multiple disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, nanotechnology, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community building, we bring together researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share our vision of developing technologies that may one day allow for the precise mapping and functional recreation of neural architectures. We believe that whole brain emulation represents not only a profound scientific challenge but also a potential pathway to extending human experience, knowledge, and consciousness beyond current biological limitations. For over 15 years, we have been at the forefront of research and development in this field, fostering collaboration between leading neuroscientists, technologists, and visionaries who share our mission. Our efforts have been powered by a dedicated community-over 100 volunteers have contributed to our initiatives over the years, with 30+ actively driving our programs forward today. As a Volunteer HR Recruiter at the Carboncopies Foundation, you will play a vital role in building our diverse team of talented contributors who share our vision for advancing whole brain emulation technology. You will assist in managing the influx of applications from prospective volunteers and interns, ensuring a smooth and efficient recruitment process. This position offers a unique opportunity to help shape the human capital of an organization at the cutting edge of neuroscience and technology while developing valuable skills in nonprofit human resources management.

    "description": "This is a remote opportunity! At Four Paws of Hope, safety and security of an animal is one of our top priorities and strive to foster long lasting relationships between humans and animals. But we also understand life happens and to no one's fault an animal needs to be rehomed. However, many people post on social media to rehome their pets. Unfortunately, more likely than not, unless you personally know the person, your pet is going to end up in an unsafe situation. This program was created to help pet owners vet potential adopters and assist with a safe transition that would act in the best interest of the pet.

You would be matched with an older adult, and you would help that specific homeowner for the summer. Some homeowners have lawn mowers for volunteers to use, but others don\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t have your own or can\u2019t transport, we\u2019d match you with someone that has one. Lawn mowing is usually completed weekly, depending on the amount of rain, how fast or slow the grass is growing, etc. If you know that you\u2019ll be out of town or unavailable for a period of time just let us know, and we will find an alternate volunteer to help mow during that time.",

    "description": "In 1982, angels led us on a route called, Christmas Star, to a beautiful desert mountain valley where we built a church. On the first day of Advent, December 5, 1982, the chapel was completed and dedicated, simply, to God. That's what the sign out front says, a church to God, all faiths welcome. What's it about? Bringing peace on earth, good will to men and woman - one by one, one heart at a time. Unfortunately, no one hears about it or the angels who come. But this church is not to take anyone from his or her faith or way of knowing God (by whatever name they may call Him). It is about learning together and being at peace with our neighbors. Sounds simple? But right now, the way people are divided, that's probably why no one comes. Heaven on earth can begin one by one, and two by two. Want to come? It would be beautiful if someone heard the angels loving message. \"We have come but for one purpose, and that is to prepare a way for the coming of the Messiah.\" See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1boGeX3umrLouZ8cCQzBNr10chgLwe9jOiKPsN1xyxEE/edit?usp=sharing or the Association of Universal Philosophy on Facebook. Would you like to help angels gather a flock -- Not to take people from their own churches, temples, synagogs, or mosques, but simply to add to what they already know? We are asked to love God one-tenth as much a He loves us, and to love one another in the same manner. In this way, we will be building a temple of God within our hearts, and thus upon the Earth. For the temple is not a building, it is being built within each man and woman. It is how a way will be prepared for the coming of the Messiah on Earth. \"New words shall be written upon the sky, but they must be written in men's hearts first,\" the angels say.

More and more children are growing up in broken homes, homicides are crazy high, too many people continue to be homeless, etc. We need to do better at meeting the needs of the people, and we need to meet them where they are. For that reason, we\u2019ve been working with community leaders and RPD to came up with a system of check -ins. We do this by going out speaking with community members, asking them to simply make calls to 3-5 of their friends or family members in the area once a month to check up on them. The goal of the check-ins is to help people at their most vulnerable times. Hurt people, hurt people. The best way to fight violence that comes from hurt people hurting people, is to get help for them before they spread the hurt. It hurts to be depressed, lonely, angry, etc. With our check-ins we want to be able to get resources to people before things become detrimental to themselves, their families and the community. So, I hope you will join us. You could be the first step in making a hugh difference in someones life.",

Since 1991, garden members have continue the tradition of engaging with neighbors to expand their knowledge of plants and learn how to their own food in an urban setting. Join us for a hands-on volunteer day to help beautify the garden for GreenThumb's 44th Annual Harvest Fair! We'll work to prepare the pathways, restore and paint garden furniture, remove weeds, and collect debris. This is a great opportunity to support a dynamic community space while learning about urban agriculture. Please wear comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing and bring water and snacks. Note: Some tasks may involve lifting heavy materials and extended periods of bending, squatting, and moving. For information about group volunteering, please contact GreenThumb's Volunteer Program Coordinator at Kyleen.Sanchez@parks.nyc.gov.",

    "description": "Youth Creating Change believes in the true power of young people. Combining arts-based curricula and a commitment to youth empowerment, our programs facilitate healing and belonging through creative expression, encourage help-seeking, equip youth to support their peers, and reduce stigma to normalize important conversations around suicide prevention and mental health. In pursuing our mission of youth-empowerment around mental health, we also seek to remind our participants that their experiences and feelings matter by allowing them to safely process emotions around current events and elevating voices that speak up for change. Youth that participate in our contests don\u2019t just learn about mental health and suicide prevention - they also collaborate with peers, share their unique perspectives, and create films and art that reduce stigma and show those who are struggling that they aren\u2019t alone. In doing so, these youth also learn first-hand how impactful their voices and their stories can be in shaping narratives around these topics; supporting inclusive communities where others feel seen, heard, and safe opening up to others; and providing much-needed sources of hope in these uncertain times. For our signature program, The Directing Change Film Contest, volunteer judges evaluate youth-created submissions on suicide prevention, mental health, and social justice each March . Participation in the program prepares youth to recognize signs of distress and seek help for themselves or a friend while inviting them to share their own unique message about suicide prevention and mental health with their peers. PSAs created for the contest are also used to raise awareness as part of media campaigns and outreach across California. All Youth Creating Change judging is completed remotely online and allows judges to participate flexibly at the time that works best for them. While the exact time required to evaluate submissions varies throughout the year, most judging periods require a time commitment of approximately 2 hours or less (not including a short orientation presentation which we also share with judges each spring). Forms are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, and you will receive a confirmation email with additional details once your form has been processed (depending on staff availability, this process may take several weeks). For Hope & Justice, judging occurs intermittently throughout the school year (typically the second week of each month). Youth across the state are invited to express their thoughts and feelings around critical mental health topics, as well as social justice and current events through the creation of visual art, written works, short films, audio PSAs, original music, and more. Participants can submit entries to the theme of \"Hope,\" \"Justice,\" or in response to an educational monthly prompt centered on mental health, healthy coping mechanisms, and available support resources.

Volunteer Clovers are either \"people engagers\", \"equipment operators\", or \"clean up crew\". We teach you everything you need to know, including how to safely operate our equipment. We are open to the public \"every day with a T in it\" so that's Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 11am-7pm, BUT we are prepping material for sale on the other days.
